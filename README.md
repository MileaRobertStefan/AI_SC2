## Introduction

The game is a real-time-strategy game, where the players choose a race and 
start with a base and some workers. Their purpose is to develop their workers, 
army, structures and upgrades in such a way that they can defeat the enemy.

## Description

Zagara is an open-source Zerg AI based on BurnySc2 APIs that uses a combination
of genetic algorithms and raw tactics to play as hardcore as possible

Zagara falls under the next AI categories:
Limited Memory / Artificial Narrow Intelligence

## Tactics

### Macro

She tries to gather as much information as possible about the enemy

Zagara uses all the intel she has in order to decide probabilistically what’s 
the best macro action she can take.

She tries to put pressure on the enemy by attacking on several flanks.

### Micro

On the Micro level, Zagara knows how to:
- Evaluate fights and pre-decide whether she wins or loses
- Control every unit in the most efficient way (kite in, kite back, retreat, 
using particular abilities, focus attack on enemies, special behavior for the 
type of unit, and many more!)
